# PSeudo
[Get the latest PSeudo 0.72 release for Mac](https://github.com/dkoluris/pseudo/releases/tag/version-0.72)

PSeudo aims to be the world's simplest PSX emulator both in terms of user experience and software implementation. It is coded in C++ and is utilizing modern APIs such as OpenGL for visuals and OpenAL for audio. I have been developing this emulator on a Mac, so for the time being it works on macOS & iOS. This will change in future releases; more platforms will be supported, as I am aiming for a cross-platform solution.
