**PSeudo aims to be the world's simplest PSX emulator** both in terms of user experience and software implementation. It is coded in **C++** and is utilizing modern APIs such as **OpenGL** for visuals and **OpenAL** for audio. I have been developing this emulator on a Mac, so for the time being it works on **macOS** & **iOS**. This will change in future releases; more platforms will be supported, as I am aiming for a cross-platform solution.
